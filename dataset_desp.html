    <h2 style="color: #2f5496;">Data Understanding</h2>
    <p>In this project, we use two datasets from two different data sources for Bank Customer Churn Prediction. All of
        the data used in this project came from a public data source and can be reused by others. The reference list
        contains citations or references to the dataset.</p>
    <p><strong>About Datasets</strong></p>

    <p>The first dataset that we use in our analysis has the following feature:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>RowNumber&mdash;corresponds to the record (row) number and has no effect on the output.</li>
        <li>CustomerId&mdash;contains random values and has no effect on customer leaving the bank.</li>
        <li>Surname&mdash;the surname of a customer has no impact on their decision to leave the bank.</li>
        <li>CreditScore&mdash;can have an effect on customer churn, since a customer with a higher credit score is less
            likely to leave the bank.</li>
        <li>Geography&mdash;a customer&rsquo;s location can affect their decision to leave the bank.</li>
        <li>Gender&mdash;it&rsquo;s interesting to explore whether gender plays a role in a customer leaving the bank.
        </li>
        <li>Age&mdash;this is certainly relevant, since older customers are less likely to leave their bank than younger
            ones.</li>
        <li>Tenure&mdash;refers to the number of years that the customer has been a client of the bank. Normally, older
            clients are more loyal and less likely to leave a bank.
            <ul>
                <li>Balance&mdash;also a very good indicator of customer churn, as people with a higher balance in their
                    accounts are less likely to leave the bank compared to those with lower balances.</li>
                <li>NumOfProducts&mdash;refers to the number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank.
                </li>
                <li>HasCrCard&mdash;denotes whether or not a customer has a credit card. This column is also relevant,
                    since people with a credit card are less likely to leave the bank.</li>
                <li>IsActiveMember&mdash;active customers are less likely to leave the bank.</li>
                <li>EstimatedSalary&mdash;as with balance, people with lower salaries are more likely to leave the bank
                    compared to those with higher salaries.</li>
                <li>Exited&mdash;whether or not the customer left the bank.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The second dataset that we use in our analysis has the following feature:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>CUST_ID&mdash;This column name contains random values assigned to each customer and has no effect on whether
            or not they leave the bank. It is simply a unique identifier for each customer. This feature does not impact
            the prediction model.</li>
        <li>AGE&mdash;This feature could potentially impact the machine learning model as younger or older customers may
            be more or less likely to churn.</li>
        <li>INCOME&mdash;It could potentially impact the machine learning model as customers with higher incomes may be
            more or less likely to churn.</li>
        <li>CHURN&mdash;This feature indicates whether or not the customer has churned. This is the target variable that
            we want to predict, and it is the most important feature in the dataset.</li>
        <li>INVESTMENT&mdash;This feature represents the amount of investment made by the customer. This feature could
            potentially impact the machine learning model as customers who have made significant investments with the
            bank may be more or less likely to churn.</li>
        <li>ACTIVITY&mdash;This feature represents the level of activity of the customer. This feature could potentially
            impact the machine learning model as customers who are more active with the bank may be more or less likely
            to churn.</li>
        <li>YRLY_AMT&mdash;This feature represents the total yearly amount spent by the customer. This feature could
            potentially impact the machine learning model as customers who spend more with the bank may be more or less
            likely to churn.</li>
        <li>AVG_DAILY_TX&mdash;This attribute indicates the average number of daily transactions performed by the
            consumer and it has influence on machine learning model from customer who conducts transaction.</li>
        <li>YRLY_TAX&mdash;This feature indicates the customer's total annual expenditures. It affects the prediction
            model from customer spend.</li>
        <li>AVG_TX_AMT&mdash;This feature indicates the average transaction amount per client transaction. Customers
            that conduct larger or smaller transactions with the bank may be more or less likely to churn, depending on
            the effect of this characteristic on the machine learning model.</li>
        <li>NEGTWEETS&mdash;This feature represents the number of negative tweets posted by the customer. This feature
            could potentially impact the machine learning model as customers who have posted more negative tweets about
            the bank may be more or less likely to churn.</li>
        <li>STATE&mdash;This feature represents the state in which the customer resides. This feature could potentially
            impact the machine learning model as customers from different states may be more or less likely to churn.
        </li>
        <li>EDUCATION: This feature represents the education level of the customer. This feature could potentially
            impact the machine learning model as customers with different education levels may be more or less likely to
            churn.</li>
        <li>EDUCATION_GROUP: This feature represents the education level of the customer grouped into categories. This
            feature could potentially impact the machine learning model as customers in different education groups may
            be more or less likely to churn.</li>
        <li>TWITTERID: This feature contains random values and its purpose or meaning is not clear from the given
            dataset. It is possible that this feature was included in the dataset by mistake or that it was used for
            some other purpose that is not related to the customer churn prediction task as the same sense of CUST_ID
        </li>
    </ul>
